# You and Your Technical Community

IT Professionals often work in isolation and ignore the large number of other people doing similar work. But there are benefits to connecting with others in your community.

In today's presentation, I will share with you how others have helped advance my career and how I connected with them. I'll show you how you can enhance your career by drawing on the experiences of those around you. And how to have fun doing it.

    NOTE: This presentation is usually delivered as a conference keynote!

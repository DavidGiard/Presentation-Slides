# We Want the Func! Serverless Computing with Azure Functions

Azure Functions allow you to write, deploy, and test code without worrying about where that code runs. Scalability, reliability, and server management are handled for you in this example of a "serverless" technology, so that you can focus on the code.

In this session, you will learn how to create, test, and deploy Azure functions; how to trigger them using REST calls, queues, database, and a scheduled interval; how to bind functions declaratively to other technologies; and how to create long-running durable transaction in Azure functions.

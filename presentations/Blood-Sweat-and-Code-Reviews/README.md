# Blood, Sweat, & Code Reviews

## Abstract

Code Reviews can sometime be painful and time-consuming, but they are an important part of delivering quality software. A Code Review provides an opportunity to share knowledge, improve code and catch potential problems before they go to production. This can be a positive experience or a negative experience.

In this session, I will discuss the importance of Code Reviews and show some ways you can make your code reviews more productive, enjoyable, and successful.
